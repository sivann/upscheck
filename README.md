This is historical code, better use NUT or similar software nowdays.

UPS monitor daemon, for unix- (or POSIX)- compatible OSes. Works with Advance-Intelligent UPSes such as X power Piconet and Micronet, Megatec, Falcon SG, et.c Tested only with the X Power Micronet. This code has been tested with linux & Solaris 2.7. 

It should compile on other unix boxes with little or no modification. I wrote this in a couple of days to replace the original bloated java monitoring software (winpower,http://www.ups-software-download.com) that takes up more than 40MB of memory just for monitoring and another 40MB while configuring. Moreover, it didn't work at all. The upschk daemon worked fine so far for numerous power-failures.
